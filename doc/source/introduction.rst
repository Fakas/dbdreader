Introduction to dbdreader
*************************

The python module dbdreader is a module that can be used to read
binary data files that are generated by Teledyne WebbResearch Slocum
gliders see http://www.webbresearch.com.

The Slocum gliders produce binary data files that contain engineering
data or science data. Engineering data are stored in sbd or dbd files,
where sbd files contain a subset of the dbd files. Science data are
stored in tbd and ebd files. Also here the tbd files contain a subset
of the parameters in the ebd files.

The dbdreader module provides APIs for accessing a single binary file
or multiple binaries. The module lets you, for example,

- read the measured depth of a given dbd file, 
- retrieve CTD data from multiple ebd files, 
- retrieve heading, roll and pitch, interpolated on the time basis of
  depth



Installing dbdreader
====================

dbdreader is written for python3. Python2.7 support is provided by
using the future module.

The latest dbdreader module is available from the python package index
(https://pypi.python.org), so that you can install it using pip (or
the python3 version of pip, pip3 or pip-python3).

Install using pip::

  pip dbdreader

or, fetching the source. Then, simply follow these steps.


Get the source::

  $ wget https://pypi.python.org/packages/source/d/dbdreader/dbdreader-0.3.6.tar.gz

Unpack the tarball::

   $ tar xvzf dbdreader-0.3.6.tar.gz

Install the package::

  $ cd dbdreader-0.3.6
  $ python3 setup.py build
  $ sudo python3 setup.py install



Dbdreader quickstart
====================

The package comes with a number of examples. however, to give you a
flavour of how easy it is to read one or two variables, consider the
example code below.

::

   import dbdreader
   
   dbd = dbdreader.DBD("unit204-2014-212-0-0.dbd")
   t,d = dbd.get("m_depth")
   dbd.close()
